# QualificationPractice
 A python Tkinter applet that allows for the tracking of fundamental physics skills for the TTU qualification exam.

Using:
 python 3.9.5

Overall procedure:
 A set of skills is defined based on the primary texts we are using. Each question lists the required skills in order to solve it. As you answer questions, the program tracks the success rate of the skills you are using.

 When a question is shown the answer is hidden. Once the user has completed the question, they can reveal the answer and compare the result. The skills are also shown at this time (as to not give any hints to how to solve the problem). If their answer is incorrect, they should go back and find any errors and correct. Thus they should then select how they applied each skill by selecting a success rating.

 Each success rating is listed as the following:
  0 Resources and Incorrect - used resources (book, notes, formula chart) and applied the skill incorrectly
  1 No Resources and Incorrect - did not use resources and did not apply the skill correctly
  2 Resources and Correct - Used resources and applied the skill correctly.
  3 No Resources and Correct - Did not use resources and applied the skills correctly.

This program is purely designed to target skills that one is doing poorly on and drill them as well as occasionally review old skills.
